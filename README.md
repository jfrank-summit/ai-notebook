# My AI Playground Notebook

This repository contains my personal Jupyter Notebook, which I use as a playground for AI-related learning and testing. The purpose of this notebook is to provide an interactive space for me to experiment with various AI concepts, algorithms, and tools, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.

**Note:** This notebook is my personal playground and is not necessarily meant to be user-friendly for others. It is currently unstructured and may lack explanations or comments. However, in the future, I may consider adding structure and documentation to help others learn from the experiments conducted within the notebook.
